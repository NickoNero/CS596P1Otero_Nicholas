Game Play: you pilot a character model dub "ethan" from the 3rd person character controller that can easliy imported in Unity.
You can jump around and see which area you can get based. 

PLEASE NOTE: when you fall off the platform or go into the hole there is no way of saving you. just quit out of the game.

Procedurally Generated Content: The environment is procedurally generated from a script in the scripts
folder called Grided and the folder is just called Scripts.

Wish List. To make the entire thing super wavy. If you look at the code there is a waving method that is meant to do just that but
i ran into erros that made the plane not be created.
