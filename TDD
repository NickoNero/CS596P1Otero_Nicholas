##Test Driven Document

(note its not very clear as to what a TDD is since we rarely ever went over it, but this is 
my best attempt)

The complexity of this code is On^2 (big O n squared) complexity because of the generate 
method and the process it creates the plane. 

At least for the method. Once the call is done thats it and the script does not affect anything else. just Makes the plane.

Other than the methods for Ethan which i do not want to dive into and since i did not make the wavy function operate
(which also has On^2 complexity) there are no consistent scripts being used here that are not from the unity engine itself
(such as rigidbodys and colliders).

//I also want to note that my computer was pretty much on 20% power when i made this and was draining fast and i would not be able to charge it till monday.
