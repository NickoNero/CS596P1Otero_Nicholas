##Test Driven Document
-by Nicholas Otero for CS596P1Otero_Nicholas

The only script i have for this project (other than those built and came witrh ethan for the 3d controller) is that of 

Grided.cs

//i'll in turn go in depth and talk about the complexity for the methods because they have several conditionals and for loops

-Private void Generate()
	Conditionals:
		-if statements:1
		-for statements:4(2 groups are nested)
	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-6

-Void MeshWave() //note this method is not used in Grided.cs as it was attempted to produce waves out of the plane
	Conditionals:
		-for statements:2(nested)
	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-3

-Private void OnDrawGizmos()
	Conditionals:
		-if statements:1
		-for statements:1
	Cyclomatic Complexity:
		-3

If i used Meshwave method the total cost complexity would be 3On^2 (3 big O of n squared).
Remember i am not including the complexities for the 3d player controller.
